\# JavaScript Fundamentals ‚Äì Learning Summary



Hi, I'm Tina Johnson. This project is a summary of the key concepts I‚Äôve learned in JavaScript so far. It‚Äôs been exciting to build a solid foundation in programming.

\## üåü What I Learned



\- \*\*Why JavaScript is Amazing:\*\* It's powerful, versatile, and used everywhere ‚Äî from browsers to servers.

\- \*\*Running Scripts:\*\* Use `node filename.js` to run JavaScript in the terminal.

\- \*\*Variables \& Constants:\*\* Use `let` and `const`. Avoid `var`.

\- \*\*Data Types:\*\* String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Object, Array, Function.

\- \*\*Conditionals:\*\* `if`, `else` to control the flow of logic.

\- \*\*Loops:\*\* Use `for` and `while` to repeat actions.

\- \*\*Comments:\*\* `//` for single-line, `/\* \*/` for multi-line comments.

\- \*\*Functions:\*\* Reusable blocks of code. Return `undefined` by default if no `return` is used.

\- \*\*Scope:\*\* Variables can be global or block/function scoped.

\- \*\*Operators:\*\* `+`, `-`, `\*`, `/`, `%`, `\*\*` for math operations.

\- \*\*Objects (Dictionaries):\*\* Store key-value pairs.

\- \*\*Importing Files:\*\* Use `require()` in Node.js to reuse code from other files.

\- \*\*Special Keywords:\*\* `break` exits loops early, `continue` skips to the next iteration.

This journey has helped me understand not just how to write JavaScript, but how to think like a programmer. I‚Äôm proud of this foundation and excited to keep growing!
